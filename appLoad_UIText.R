About_OutputValues <- paste0('A simulation run includes the step-by-step execution of the population expansion model from year 0 (initial territories) to year 5 (or year 10 if selected). Here, simulation outputs include 15 runs starting from a similar set of initial population territories. 
Once all simulation runs are complete, the number of runs predicting occupancy on a given year is summed for each cell. The total number of runs predicting occupancy is then partitioned into pre-determined categories to facilitate summary mapping: 1 to 3 runs, 3 to 5 runs, 5 to 10 runs, 10 to 15 runs. Outputs can also be visualised and exported as the convex hulls for the set of cells included at a given level of simulated occupancy.
Each cell is then coloured according to the number of runs associated with it. Note that due to the stochasticity in dispersal routes and choice of habitat for building territories, low beaver densities in relation to suitable habitat area will often be associated with low numbers of runs per cell.'

Release protocol 
Only one single group of beavers can be release within a habitat cell; it is currently a model requirement and is representative of practice in the field. The habitat map resolution is of 1ha. The algorithm generating automated release point coordinates aims for the target number of released groups to be distributed 300m apart within the extent and all within suitable habitat, ensuring only one beaver group can be attributed per cell. In other protocols, points are located manually or concentrated around a single starting point. In those cases, the algorithm verifies that the assumptions of distance, suitability and extent boundaries are respected for the set of points, and relocates points to a nearest adequate location when they are not. This process may take time as it is both iterative and considers the changing distribution of all points.

Translocated population size 
Given the individual-based nature of the algorithm, the number of individuals in the simulation affects the amount of computations required to account for all the beaver population. Individual dispersal routes in particular may demand longer computation time when the number of dispersers (sub-adults) increase or when dispersal routes become longer (due to reduced options for instance).

Landscape and habitat
The distribution of habitat quality patches will influence dispersal routes. Failed dispersal may take longer to simulate as each attempt is computed even if unproductive, before the individual is considered stranded (and removed from the simulated population). Dispersal routes will also increase in length when animals have to travel far to find a patch for settlement, or test then leave sub-optimal patches, or have to move within large dispersal-only patches.

Duration of simulation runs 
Computation time will increase with the number of individuals alive in the simulation; in positive growth, the difference in overall computation time between a 5 and 10 years simulation for each run may be significant.

AboutPars_suit<-  paste0("Spatial dynamics of the beavers integrate with an underlying habitat map provided by NatureScot, used to describe territories and movement.

The average breeding probability is 0.6; the average litter size is 1.95, with a maximum value of 9 young produced annually per adult pair.")  
AboutTheModel <- paste0("The landscape population model of Shirley et al. (2015) predicts the spatial spread of beavers from spatially defined territories and a habitat map. The model is described in detail in the 2015 report but for summary the main processes are outlined here. The population model is dynamic and runs on an annual timestep, the spatial dynamics of the beavers integrate with an underlying habitat map used to describe territories and movement.  The habitat map is divided into three categories of habitat: ‘suitable’ habitat which can support a beaver territory; dispersal habitat which cannot support a territory but can be used by beavers; and ‘unsuitable habitat’ which can neither support a territory nor be used by beavers. The population dynamics are based around individual beaver families. 
This is a process-based model, meaning that life-history processes (population dynamics) of mortality, mating, birth, and dispersal are explicitly modelled at the family level on a yearly timestep. Each family consists of a pair of breeding beavers plus zero or more non-breeding adults, subadults, and juveniles. Each family also has a spatially-referenced territory containing sufficient suitable habitat to support the family. Each year, each beaver has a probability of dying equal to the sex-specific mortality rate. Each beaver family with both a breeding male and a breeding female has a probability of producing a litter of kits. Some of these kits will join the family as subadults, but others will disperse away from the natal territory. 
Dispersal is the most complex process to model since it subsumes a multitude of behaviours. In the model each disperser leaves the natal territory and initially travels through beaver-permeable habitat without attempting to settle (up to a maximum dispersal distance). It then attempts to find or establish a territory. If it finds another beaver territory that it can join as a breeding adult then it does so, otherwise it searches for suitable habitat that falls outside another territory. If it locates sufficient contiguous habitat then it establishes a territory. This beaver must be joined by a dispersing mate before it can breed.")
