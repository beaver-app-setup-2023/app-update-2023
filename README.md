# A Beaver Translocation Simulation App
Major updates to a Shiny App developped by zelda at the University of Newcastle (UK) for NatureScot (Nov. 2022).

## About
As part of a beaver landscape modelling tender Newcastle University produced a desk-based tool to inform future beaver management decision-making with the initial aims to : 
- work with NatureScot staff (and potentially other stakeholders) in designing and producing a desk-based tool which applies the beaver population model, and informs beaver management decision-making

- assess to what extent other models (e.g. the beaver dam capacity model) can be built into the desk-based tool and, if feasible, to incorporate them into the desk-based tool

The app was developed using the Beauly catchment as an example with a view to extending the capability to other potential release areas. User documentation reports the current capabilities, limitations and future developments discussed with NatureScot colleagues (available from).

## Built With

Shiny for Rstudio

[Link to Shiny main page](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

### Installation

How to build or install the applcation.

### Running Locally

How to run the application on your local system.

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
